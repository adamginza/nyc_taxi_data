# NYC Taxi Data EDA and Modelling

This is my attempt in doing EDA and predict taxi fare and tip amount based on the given data.

There are 2 data that were used in this analysis:
* Trip data: Details of trips including the pickup and dropoff place and time, number of passengers, etc
* Trip fare: Details the fare and tip amount paid by the customer.
